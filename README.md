_Scripts to assist with Project Euler problems_

More on Project Euler [here](https://projecteuler.net/about).

I know Project Euler does not enforce its ban on publication of solutions to its problems 
for the first hundred problems, but what fun would it be to solve these puzzles if I 
just _gave_ you the answer?  You can at least put forth the effort to review my code,
figure out how I was approaching the problem, and come up with a reasonable way to get
the solution by running each program a certain way.  

To be fair, some of these scripts _do_ just "spit out the answer".  I have not tried
to obscure my code, but have kept comments to a minimum because I do not want to spoil
the puzzle.

Enjoy!  I will add more scripts as I solve more problems.
